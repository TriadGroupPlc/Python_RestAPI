# Python_RestApi
Python Rest Api is a sample project to give idea on how easy it is to create Rest Api usning Python and Flask Api.
taking a simple Customer form as input,I have 3 created endpoints for the basicRead and write operations.

1. http://127.0.0.1:5000/getAllCustomer
2. http://127.0.0.1:5000/getCustomer?reference=2
3. http://127.0.0.1:5000/saveCustomer 

To run the project execute the cmd -  "flask --app main run" in the terminal [you would need Python and Flask api installed].

I have also attached the Postman collection which can be used for testing the endpoints,"Python-RestApi.postman_collection"
